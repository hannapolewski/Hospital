# Hospitalized Ai

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI idea for nurses could be to develop a virtual assistant than can assist with patient monitoring, medication management and provide guidence on care protocols. It could help alleviate workload and enhance patient safety. 


## Background

An AI assistant for nurses solves several problems, including easing the workload by automating tasks like patient monitoring and medication management. It can also enhance patient safety by providing reliable guidance on care protocols and alerts for any deviations. Overall, it would streamline workflow and improve the quality of care


## How is it used?
An AI assistant for nurses could be used through a mobile application or a web platform. Nurses would be able to log in and use the assistant to access patient information, receive medication reminders, and receive guidance on care protocols. The assistant can also be used to monitor patient data and provide alerts for any deviations. It would be a valuable resource for nurses to streamline their work and enhance patient care.

## Data sources and AI methods

Medical literature, patient records, or publicly available health datasets. As for AI methods, natural language processing (NLP) techniques like text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition could be useful. Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, or deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) could also be employed. The choice of data sources and AI methods will depend on the goals and requirements of your project.

## Challenges

Some challenges of implementing an AI assistant for nurses include ensuring data privacy and security, integrating the assistant with existing healthcare systems, and maintaining accuracy and reliability of the AI algorithms. Additionally, there may be challenges in training the AI to understand and respond appropriately to complex medical situations. However, with proper development and testing, these challenges can be overcome to create a valuable tool for nurses

## What next?
Developing skills and assistance in areas such as natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis. This could involve creating an AI assistant that can understand and respond to user queries, provide personalized recommendations, or assist with specific tasks in a particular domain, such as healthcare or customer service.
